Basic Installation
==================
The simplest process to build and install this utility is:

./config
make
make install

Strictly speaking the 'make install' step is not required to
run the utility as it is a single stand alone program for now.

The config script controls various compile time parameters and
generates the actual Makefile. You can get a short description
of all the options by running:

./config --help

A more descriptive account is given below:

./config [<options>]

<options> can be one of the following:

--prefix=<val>		The installation prefix. 
			This is set to /usr by default. However alternate
			prefix needs to eb used during packaging.

--enable-debug		Enable debug mode compilation.
			This reduces the compiler optimization level to basic
			and taks out all the loop optimization flags. This is
			primary to aid debugging.

--disable-allocator	Disable use of internal memory allocator mechanism.
			The internal allocator can be totally disabled by setting
			this build time flag. It is also possible to dynamically
			disable the allocator by setting the following env variable:
			ALLOCATOR_BYPASS=1

--enable-debug-stats	Enable printing of some verbose debug info.
			This at present shows some info related to Dedupe
			efficiency.

--help			Display the help message.
